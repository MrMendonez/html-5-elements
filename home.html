        Recognize that the very molecules that make up your body, 
        the atoms that construct the molecules, 
        are traceable to the crucibles that were once the centers of high mass stars 
        that exploded their chemically rich guts into the galaxy, 
        enriching pristine gas clouds with the chemistry of life. 
        So that we are all connected to each other biologically, 
        to the earth chemically, 
        and to the rest of the universe atomically... 
        It's not that we are better than the universe, 
        we are part of the universe. 
        We are in the universe 
        and the universe is in us...
        -Neil deGrasse Tyson

      One day Alice came to a fork in the road and saw a Cheshire cat in a tree. 'Which road do I take?' she asked. 'Where do you want to go?' was his response. 'I don't know,' Alice answered. 'Then,' said the cat, 'it doesn't matter.'
