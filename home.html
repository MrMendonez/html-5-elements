        Welcome to my travel blog! Here I hope to share the many adventures I've taken. Although, I have only seen a glimpse of the world, what I've seen has been truly amazing and I hope these pictures at least capture a taste of each country's or island's beauty <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i> <i class="fa fa-globe"></i>

    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>
      One day Alice came to a fork in the road and saw a Cheshire cat in a tree. 'Which road do I take?' she asked. 'Where do you want to go?' was his response. 'I don't know,' Alice answered. 'Then,' said the cat, 'it doesn't matter.'
